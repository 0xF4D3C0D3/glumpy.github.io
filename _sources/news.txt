:17/01/2015: `Glumpy version 1.0
             <https://github.com/glumpy/glumpy/releases/tag/v1.0>`_ is out !

             After intense refactoring, glumpy 1.0 is out. This is a brand new
             version much more powerful and beautiful than previous versions
             and comes with a bunch of examples (make sure to look at the
             different examples) and eye-candy demos. The documentation is not
             yet up-to-date but this is the next milestone.
